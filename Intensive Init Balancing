HI Devs,

Because what I have seen as an extreme imbalance in megamek initiatives. I would like to have reqest a better and more comprehensive intitiative balancing mechanism.

I would like one that makes more sense. Total Init Compensation Rule.
If one player has won 6 inits, and the other one has won 10 inits, then the init compensation value is +4. 
This continues for each turn, so then if it is 7 vs 10 then it becomes +3, when it say matches at 12 and 12 then it becomes zero. 
Total init Compensation balancing option
